A simple demo app that shows the mixed use of "normal" sproutcore view with
templateviews: It's the google image search client. Again. Sorry.
I made this for my talk at jsconf.it in 2011.

To run it, just clone it, make sure you have sproutcore installed, and run 
sc-server from within the directory.
